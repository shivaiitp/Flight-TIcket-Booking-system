# Flight Ticket Booking System

A simple flight booking system developed by our team using the C programming language. This project was assigned during our second semester of B.Tech and incorporates various programming concepts such as sorting algorithms, dynamic memory allocation, file handling, and string manipulation.

## Introduction

The Flight Ticket Booking System is a console-based application that allows users to book flight tickets, view flight schedules, and manage passenger information. The system utilizes data structures and algorithms to efficiently handle booking operations and data storage.

## Features

- **Flight Management**: Add, view, and manage flight details.
- **Passenger Management**: Book tickets, view passenger information, and manage bookings.
- **Data Persistence**: Utilize file handling to store flight and passenger data persistently.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implement sorting techniques to organize and display flight schedules.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Efficiently manage memory for data storage and retrieval.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Development Environment**: GCC, Code::Blocks / VS Code (or any C compiler)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler (or any C compiler)
- Terminal / Command Prompt

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivaiitp/Flight-TIcket-Booking-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Flight-TIcket-Booking-system
   ```

3. Compile the source code:

   ```bash
   gcc cs_project.c -o FlightBookingSystem
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./FlightBookingSystem
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to use the system.

## File Structure

- `cs_project.c`: Main source code file containing the implementation of the flight booking system.
- `flight_data.csv`: Contains flight details such as flight number, destination, and schedule.
- `Passengers_data.csv`: Stores information about passengers and their bookings.
- `Seat_arrangement.csv`: Manages seat allocation for different flights.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
